# Upcoming company account verification requirements

Due to new regulatory requirements, including the European Union Digital Services Act, and our commitment to customer confidence, Microsoft Store developers who have company accounts in Partner Center must provide more detailed information.

## When does this go into effect?

Any new company accounts are already required to enter in their Dun & Bradstreet D-U-N-S® Number or supporting documents during account creation. **Existing partners will have until early 2025** to upload their D-U-N-S® Number or business verification information or they will be blocked from making edits to new or existing apps in impacted markets.

## Business verification

- Beginning in October, Microsoft will enable all existing company accounts in Partner Center to provide business verification information. Microsoft recommends that the fastest and easiest way to do this is to provide your business’s D-U-N-S® Number. In lieu of a D-U-N-S Number, you may upload another form of a business verification document (approval of your business verification document may take significantly longer as this document will need to go through a review process). If you do not already have a D-U-N-S® Number, you can learn more on acquiring one [here](https://www.dnb.com/duns/get-a-duns.html).
- You can check if you have a company or individual account by visiting your Partner Center dashboard.
- The deadline for updating your account information in Partner Center is February 17, 2025, but we strongly encourage partners to take action as soon as possible to avoid impacting their ability to publish.

## Why D-U-N-S Number?

D-U-N-S is an established business identification system, widely used by app stores and online marketplaces to verify trader information. D-U-N-S is available to any business and there is a no-cost option to obtain a D-U-N-S Number.

## What forms of documentation can developers submit for business verification if they don’t have a D-U-N-S Number?

For the fastest and easiest verification, we recommend obtaining and providing a D-U-N-S Number. If, however, it is not possible to obtain one, Microsoft will accept several forms of business verification documentation:

- Official business documents, such as a business registration form, business charter, or articles of incorporation that lists Entity name and address as it is stated on Partner’s account.
- Memorandum of association, or any similar company formation document.
- Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K, or equivalent filing.
- Annual report.
- A stock ledger.
- Bank account related document.
- Tax-related document.
- The partnership agreement and registration documents with the names of partners.
- Sole proprietorship registration documents, which indicate the ownership of the entity.
- The franchise purchase agreement.
- Invoices (billed to supplier organization).
- Contract.

## Customer contact information

If you have a company account, Microsoft requires that you enter customer contact information for each product available in the Microsoft Store. Once this is provided, the contact information will appear on the Product Detail page.

- To provide customer contact information: Sign in to your [Microsoft Partner Center account](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
- To update customer contact information:
  - Sign into your Partner Center account.
  - For every product available in the European Union markets, go to the Properties page, fill the five required fields (Support contact info, Phone number, Address / Address Line 1, City, and Country), and then publish the update.
  - Once provided, this information will appear on the product detail pages.

## What if impacted developers do not update their information by the deadline?

If a valid business verification ID is not submitted by the deadline, the following action will be taken until the publisher meets compliance:

- All publisher products will be restricted from distribution in the European Union markets.

If valid customer contact information is not submitted for a product by the deadline, the following action will be taken until the publisher meets compliance:

- The product will be restricted from distribution in the European markets.
