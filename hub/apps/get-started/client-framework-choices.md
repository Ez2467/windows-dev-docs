# Choose a client app development framework

[Introduce and explain the purpose of the article.]

<!-- Required: Introductory paragraphs (no heading)

Briefly introduce the article and link to the "Overview of framework options" article for more information.

I don't want to overlap with that topic too much.

-->

## The client app development landscape

[Describe a main idea.]

<!-- Required: Main ideas - H2

This shouldn't be much more than a list of the options for Windows, web, hybrid, and cross-platform devs when using Microsoft tools.

-->

## Understand your options for native Windows apps

[Describe a main idea.]

<!-- Required: Main ideas - H2

Add an H3 for each native Windows app development framework: WinUI, WPF, and Windows Forms.

Those sections will describe the framework, its benefits, but primarily when to use it.

-->

## Cross-platform, web-based and hybrid app development

[Describe a main idea.]

<!-- Required: Main ideas - H2

Add an H3 for each type of app development: cross-platform, web-based, and hybrid.

Those sections will very briefly describe the framework, its benefits, and when to use it. I want to keep these sections high-level and focus more on the native Windows options. Clearly state the best use cases for each, perhaps in a TIP or NOTE.

-->

## Benefits, trade-offs and Microsoft's investments

[Describe a main idea.]

<!-- Required: Main ideas - H2

Sections for benefits + trade-offs, MS investments, and perhaps some customer stories or case studies.

Wrap up with a quick summary and a call to action to get started.
