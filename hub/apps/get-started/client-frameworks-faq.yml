    questions:
      - question: Which framework should I use to leverage Microsoft's latest investments in Windows app development?
        answer: |
          If you're building a new app, we recommend using the Windows App SDK. The Windows App SDK is a modern, open-source, and cross-platform app framework that enables you to build Windows apps with a single codebase. The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs, tools, and platform capabilities that you can use to build apps that run on all Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. The Windows App SDK is the best choice for building new Windows apps that leverage Microsoft's latest investments in Windows app development.
          
      - question: If I have already invested heavily in WPF, should I continue to use WPF or should I consider migrating to the Windows App SDK?
        answer: |
          If you have already invested heavily in WPF, you can continue to use WPF for your existing apps. WPF is a mature and stable framework that is widely used by developers to build Windows desktop apps. However, if you're building a new app, we recommend using the Windows App SDK. The Windows App SDK is a modern, open-source, and cross-platform app framework that enables you to build Windows apps with a single codebase. The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs, tools, and platform capabilities that you can use to build apps that run on all Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices.

          Consider leveraging the .NET Upgrade Assistant to migrate your .NET Framework WPF apps to the latest .NET platform. The .NET Upgrade Assistant is a tool that helps you migrate your .NET Framework apps to .NET 5 or later. The .NET Upgrade Assistant analyzes your existing codebase and provides guidance on how to update your code to use the latest version of .NET.
