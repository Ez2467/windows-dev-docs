  - name: Native Windows app development
    questions:
      - question: Which framework should I use to leverage Microsoft's latest investments in Windows app development?
        answer: |
          If you're building a new app, we recommend using WinUI. WinUI is the latest native UI framework for Windows app development and is designed to work across a wide range of Windows devices. WinUI provides a modern and flexible UI framework that enables you to create visually appealing and interactive Windows apps. WinUI is part of the Windows App SDK and is designed to work best with the latest versions of Windows.
          
      - question: If I have already invested heavily in WPF, should I continue to use WPF or should I consider migrating to WinUI?
        answer: |
          If you have already invested heavily in WPF, you can continue to use WPF for your existing apps. WPF is a mature and stable framework that is widely used by developers to build Windows desktop apps.

          Consider leveraging the .NET Upgrade Assistant to migrate your .NET Framework WPF apps to the latest .NET platform. The .NET Upgrade Assistant is a tool that helps you migrate your .NET Framework apps to the latest supported versions of .NET. The .NET Upgrade Assistant analyzes your existing codebase and provides guidance on how to update your code.

      - question: My team is comfortable building Windows Forms apps, and it suits our needs. Should we consider migrating to WinUI or another framework?
        answer: |
          If your team is comfortable building Windows Forms apps and Windows Forms meets your needs, you can continue to use Windows Forms for your existing apps. Windows Forms is a mature and stable framework that is widely used by developers to build Windows desktop apps.

          The Windows Forms team is investing across features and has an active community of contributors. Some current areas of investment include:

          - Async support with common controls
          - Dark mode
          - Layout flexibility
          - Desktop security features like clipboard access

      - question: Can I leverage APIs from the Windows App SDK in my existing WPF or Windows Forms apps?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can leverage many of the APIs from the Windows App SDK in your existing WPF or Windows Forms apps. The Windows App SDK is designed to work with existing Windows desktop frameworks like WPF and Windows Forms. You can use the Windows App SDK to access new features and capabilities in your existing apps.

          See [Use the Windows App SDK in an existing project](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/use-windows-app-sdk-in-existing-project) for more information.
